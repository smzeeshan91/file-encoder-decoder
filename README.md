<h1>File Encoder Decoder</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a simple C# Windows Forms based application that allows you to encode and decode any file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just click on Open File button in Form1 and select your desired file (you can also drag and drop the file to the file encoder decoder window). After that click on Encode File button. It will encode the file. Now open your file and you can see that the file has been encoded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly click on Decode File button to decode the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if you decoded a single file twice or more then you need to decode it again same number of times to get the original data/content of the file.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>It doesn't matter whether your file is ASCII or UNICODE based, it is capable to decode any kind of file regardless of its format.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy ;p)</p>
